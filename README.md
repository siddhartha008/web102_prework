- Add a search bar functionality for users to search any games
- Implement a feature where users can also add their games for pledge
- Add a "favorite" feature where users can favorite their games

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- One confusing point was understanding the .reduce() function as I had to watch multiplie online lectures on the function to grasp the concept behind it. However, with enough practice, I got the basic understanding of it.
